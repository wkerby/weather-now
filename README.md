# Weather Now
The weather-now dashboard is a simple weather dashboard designed to provide a user with both current and 5 day forecast weather data in the city of his/her choice.

## Description

As part of the challenge 6 assignment I was tasked with creating a dashboard application that returns current and 5 day forecast weather data based off of the city
that an end-user designates in his/her search. (link below in the usage section) 

Dashboard features include but are not limited to:

 - dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript
 - weather data collected from the OpenWeatherMap API 5 day weather forecast API endpoint
 - jQuery syntax for easier DOM traversal
 - user interactivity for city search

## User Story

As part of the assignment, I was asked to develop an application that would meet the needs of the following user and scenario:

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

The acceptance critetia below mor specifically covers what I was asked to provide to the end user.

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
